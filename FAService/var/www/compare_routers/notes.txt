Not sure if the ports are correct in the firewall rules:

```
config redirect
    option name 'OpenNDS'
    option src 'lan'
    option proto 'tcp'
    option src_dport '80'
    option dest_port '2050'
    option target 'DNAT'

config rule
    option name 'Allow-OpenNDS-FAS'
    option src 'lan'
    option proto 'tcp'
    option dest_port '2090'
    option target 'ACCEPT'

config rule
    option name 'Allow FAS Server'
    option src 'lan'
    option dest 'wan'
    option dest_ip '78.47.249.97'
    option target 'ACCEPT'
```

Try the following command to see if it resolves the issue:
```
/etc/init.d/firewall stop
```

HTTP Server Configuration:

    Router1 has uhttpd configured, indicating a local HTTP server setup.

Since Router2 doesn't use uhttpd, examine what services Router1 is handling with uhttpd, and whether it's necessary. Align uhttpd settings if needed or disable it temporarily and see if that resolves it.

sh
```
/etc/init.d/uhttpd stop
```
